			<p>Our organization has been working on this issue since the early 2000s, and we have continued to do this ever since. We believe the best way to accomplish our goal should be to build upon processes and institutions that are currently being utilized. We strongly support ecological sustainability, competitiveness, and security of supply in which furthering environmental progress and wellbeing is possible. It is equally as important that we help developing areas of the world such as Africa and Asia, who lack clean energy resources, and unfortunately are forced to rely on carbon emitting processes of obtaining power. Giving money to developing countries is a good way to help, but it is not the best way to assist them in the long run. We believe that the best way for our organization to help developing countries is to give prowess and expertise so they are able to develop their own ways to exploit their own resources. This can be achieved through new programs and strategies, as well as continued involvement and progression of programs that already exist such as the UNDP, which focuses on sustainable energy in the context of broader development and poverty eradication efforts and the UNEP, which works to promote resource efficiency and sustainable consumption for both developed and developing countries.
