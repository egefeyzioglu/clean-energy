			<p>The issue surrounding energy and producing it without compromising the ability of future generations is a critical issue facing the world today. The two main conflicts revolve around energy access and environmental sustainability. Globally, approximately 1.1 billion people still lack access to electricity.  Most of the people not obtaining energy live in the regions of South Asia and Africa. Many regions that have access to electricity, produce it through the burning of fossil fuels, oil, and natural gas. These resources are nonrenewable and contribute to global warming. The continued use of these resources will put the future of the environment in a ruinous path. To reduce global warming, countries around the world have been looking for other alternative sources of energy that do not produce greenhouse gases. Some of the most popular ones include solar, wind, nuclear, and hydropower. However, even the countries that have began to move toward these alternative fuels are still struggling to get the same amount of power while also spending as much. Globally, we are still trying to find a balance between focusing on implementing methods of clean energy and keeping economies and poor countries running. Our problem lies with how we create power without compromising future generations, and providing power to places on earth that lack access to it. This is what our organization hopes to accomplish.
